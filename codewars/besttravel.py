#John and Mary want to travel between a few towns A, B, C ...
#Mary has on a sheet of paper a list of distances between these towns.
#ls = [50, 55, 57, 58, 60].
#John is tired of driving and he says to Mary that he doesn't
#want to drive more than t = 174 miles and he will visit only 3 towns.
#
#Which distances, hence which towns, they will choose so that
#the sum of the distances is the biggest possible - to please Mary -
#but less than t - to please John- ?

#t-max distance
#k- number of towns
#ls-list of distances
